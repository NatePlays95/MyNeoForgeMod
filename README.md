Monster Hunter Craftlands intends to add mechanics and features, like hunting armor and weapons, pets, items and materials. It is in alpha.
Currently the focus is on implementing Palicos as hunting pets, with their equipment and behaviors.

MHCraftlands is a project I make for fun as a pastime so don't expect it to be updated frequently. The repository also contains other features that aren't fully implemented but can be accessed via commands.

Current Features
=======
- **Palicos**: Find and recruit wild Felynes, or summon one yourself with a Summon Voucher. They will help you defeat mobs and gather materials.
- **Palico Equipment**: Use _scraps_ to make unique armor and weapons for your Palico.

To-Do
=======
[] Implement Palico leveling and skills
[] Balance equipment progression to be vanilla-friendly
[] Add other lynians like Shakalaka, Melynx, Grimalkyne
[] Add Palamutes and their own systems
[] Work on Hunter weapons and armor

Asset Information
=======
Humanoid armor textures have been sourced from the internet as placeholders and are not final.
